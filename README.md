# Install GTK Themes

Custom app to install the GTK themes that I've cloned from
[Fausto Korpsvart](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart). Run it
with root privileges and pass your home folder as argument.

## Install command

```fish
sudo fish install-gtk-themes.fish $HOME
```

## Delete command

```fish
sudo fish delete-gtk-themes.fish $HOME
```

# Disclaimer

The installation only works if you have my [custom themes
repo](https://github.com/caiolaytynher/custom-themes). If you
don't, it'll ask you to clone it. Please, clone it into a folder
called `Themes` in you home folder.
