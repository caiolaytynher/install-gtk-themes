# Install GTK Themes

Custom app to install the GTK themes that I've cloned from
[Fausto Korpsvart](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart). Run it
with root privileges and pass your home folder as argument.

## Install command

```{fish}
sudo fish install-gtk-themes.fish $HOME
```

## Delete command

```{fish}
sudo fish delete-gtk-themes.fish $HOME
```
